# Quality Engineering & Automation Capabilities

This document outlines the key capabilities, frameworks, and initiatives driving quality, automation, and DevOps maturity across the CNA ecosystem. 
It includes both foundational best practices and specific solutions delivered for Playwright, API, and cloud-based testing.

---

## Delivery Quality

- **Shift-Left Testing:** Embed quality earlier in the SDLC by integrating testing at requirements, design, and development phases.
- **Quality Metrics Framework:** Establish KPIs (e.g., defect leakage, test coverage, MTTR, customer-reported issues) and monitor them across teams.
- **Code Quality Gates:** Integrate tools like SonarQube in CI pipelines to enforce static code analysis and prevent bad code from progressing.
- **Peer Reviews & Pair Programming:** Institutionalize rigorous code and test case reviews to catch defects early and enable knowledge sharing.
- **Release Readiness Criteria:** Define and enforce standardized exit criteria including performance, security, and functional validations.
- **Customer-Centric Testing:** Use persona-based testing to align quality assurance with actual user journeys.
- Integrated test framework with Xray for seamless uploading of test results to Xray.
- Enabled CNA with automated report to trace Playwright footprint & adoption of various tools delivered by EQE.

## Automation

- **Test Automation Framework:** Implement a unified framework (e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium) with modular, reusable test components.
- **Coverage-Driven Automation:** Prioritize automation based on risk, usage frequency, and change impact analysis.
- **End-to-End Automation:** Automate across layers—UI, API, DB, and Performance—for maximum test breadth.
- **Self-Healing Tests:** Integrate AI-driven capabilities to reduce flakiness and maintenance overhead of automation scripts.
- **RPA for Non-Dev Use Cases:** Leverage robotic process automation for regression-heavy manual tasks like data setup, environment provisioning.
- **CI Integration:** Trigger automated tests for every code check-in or PR, ensuring fast feedback cycles.
- Autonomous ways of reviewing Playwright code in-line with CNA defined Playwright coding standard.
- Automated workflow to publish Playwright package to JFrog with GitHub release notes and version tracking.
- Orchestration and development of Continuous Testing framework (CT) for running Playwright tests in pipeline.
- Enabled CNA to perform cross-browser testing using Farm Machine.
- Design and develop Playwright-based API automation framework for CNA.
- Enable test framework to cater various Google Cloud based capabilities (Secret Manager, Bucket, BigQuery).

## Operation Model (Centralized QA to Decentralized)

- **Federated QA Teams:** Embed QA professionals directly within product teams while maintaining a central CoE for governance and tooling.
- **Standardization with Autonomy:** Provide teams with a standard toolset, guidelines, and metrics while allowing flexibility in execution.
- **Platform-Led Enablement:** Central QA team evolves into a platform/provider model—building utilities, frameworks, and shared services.
- **Quality Champions:** Identify and empower “QA champions” within each squad to drive quality best practices locally.
- **Knowledge Sharing Culture:** Organize cross-team reviews, demos, and communities of practice to align efforts and scale learnings.
- **Tooling & Reporting as a Service:** Offer centralized dashboards, test management, and observability tools as internal services.
- Enabled CNA with automated report to trace Playwright footprint & adoption of various tools delivered by EQE.

## New Capabilities Built

- **AI-Powered Testing:** Integrate LLMs for test case generation, defect triage, and conversational QA support.
- **Performance Engineering:** Build capability for performance profiling, monitoring under load, and capacity planning.
- **Security Testing:** Implement DAST/SAST/IAST tools and train teams in secure coding practices.
- **Data-Driven Testing:** Leverage synthetic and production-like data to ensure relevance and robustness of tests.
- **Contract Testing:** Enable consumer-driven contract tests for better microservices interoperability and reduced regression scope.
- **Mobile & Accessibility Testing:** Build out expertise and toolchains for mobile-first and inclusive application experiences.
- **Resilience Testing:** Develop chaos engineering and failover simulation capabilities to validate system robustness.
- Replacing Postman with EchoAPI for API Testing and Management across CNA.
- Design and develop Playwright-based API automation framework for CNA.
- Enable test framework to cater various Google Cloud based capabilities (Secret Manager, Bucket, BigQuery).

## DevOps / CI-CD

- **Pipeline as Code:** Standardize pipeline creation using YAML-as-code across teams for consistency and repeatability.
- **Environment Parity:** Enforce “prod-like” environments throughout the pipeline to reduce deployment surprises.
- **Progressive Delivery:** Adopt blue-green, canary, or feature flag-based strategies for safer releases.
- **Test Automation in CI:** Embed static analysis, unit tests, integration tests, and security checks into the pipeline.
- **Observability and Feedback Loops:** Integrate logging, metrics, and tracing tools (e.g., ELK, Prometheus, Grafana) to detect issues early.
- **Deployment Velocity Monitoring:** Track DORA metrics (Lead Time, Deployment Frequency, Change Failure Rate, MTTR) to measure pipeline maturity.
- **Security in DevOps (DevSecOps):** Integrate automated vulnerability scanning and compliance checks in the build and deploy cycle.
- VSCode extension for seamless integration of design and development of test and ship directly to Xray from feature file.
- Automated workflow to publish Playwright package to JFrog with GitHub release notes and version tracking.
- Orchestration and development of Continuous Testing framework (CT) for running Playwright tests in pipeline.
- Enabled CNA to perform cross-browser testing using Farm Machine.
